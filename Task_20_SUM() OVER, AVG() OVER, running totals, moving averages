/* Daily Challenge: 
**Question:** Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted, running total of patients admitted (cumulative),
 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 prior weeks), and the 
difference between current week admissions and the service average. Filter for weeks 10-20 only. */
